        <p>
            It is a team programming contest which will be conducted in two stages. In the first stage, an
            online contest will be conducted on HackerEarth where top 30 teams from BIT and top 20 from other colleges will be
            selected. Although there would be a common rank list for all years, top 5 teams from first year will be selected to go
            to the next round as well. There would be multiple problems and points would be allotted on solving the problems
            totally.
