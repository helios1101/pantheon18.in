    <h2>Event Description</h2>
    <p>
        Eureka, the flagship event of Pantheon'18 is an opportunity for the smartest and quirkiest
  teenagers to bring out the explorer in themselves. For the preliminary round, the basic idea of the project is
  to be mailed along with the relevant pictures. The best entries get a chance to feature their models for the
  final exhibition.
