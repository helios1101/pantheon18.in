<p class='dummy-text'>Round 2: The top 10 teams will then have to compete against each other in a quizzing round where they have to either
identify the image shown to them or solve the visual puzzle. The rules for this quizzing round will be as follows:</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>1) The first team gets a question which if they answer are awarded with +10 points and +0 if unable to do so.
the question is however passed on to the next team if they are unable to answer.</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>2) The passed on question, if answered by any other team, will add +5 points to their total score.</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>3) Prior to a question being asked, a team may choose to double the points on offer i.e. if they are able to
answer correctly, they will be awarded +20 points. However, if the answer they provide is wrong, there
would be a negative marking i.e. -10 marks will be offered as a penalty.</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>The top 5 teams will then move on to the third round.</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>Round 3:
In this round, any one participant from the team will be shown a circuit. She/he will have to analyse the circuit and
explain the function of the circuit to the other team member, without using any electrical terminology, not even the
word. If the other team member is able to identify the name of the circuit, the team gets +20 points. Adding to this,
if the team member guessing the name of the circuit is able to draw the circuit as well, the team has the benefit of
+10 points.
If the member who is shown the circuit initially is not able to understand the circuit or analyse, he/she can get the
details from the organizers but his team stands at a penalty of -10 points.</p>

						<p class='dummy-text'>Event Name : Enigma</p>
						<p class='dummy-text'>Team Size: 2-3</p>
						<p class='dummy-text'>Event Description : In 1805, Samuel Morse invented what was going to be the most groundbreaking communication system ever, the
Morse code and telegraph. The electric telegraph transformed how wars were fought and won and how journalists
and newspapers conducted business. Rather than taking weeks to be delivered by horse-and-carriage mail carts,
pieces of news could be exchanged between telegraph stations almost instantly. This code uses small and long
electric pulses to generate “dots” and “dashes” which are used in different combinations to represent alphabets.
This event will let you get into the shoes of Samuel Morse and Sherlock Holmes at the same time as you design a
circuit which can generate Morse code and then decode the code and try to guess what your partner has got out of
the message box.</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>First the team of two contestants have to make a circuit consisting of 2 led’s and two pushbuttons (or they can tap
the wires). One LED will be to show the dots (by touching the wire for short duration) and dashes (by touching the
wire for long duration) and the other will be lighted up to show the end of the word.</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>ROUND 1: One-word messages (Pokémon names, mobile company names, food items)
Guessing the entire word correctly gives 10 points. Otherwise 1/2 points per correct alphabet.</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>ROUND 2: 3-word messages (“HE THINKS BIG”, “THEY DON’T KNOW”)
Same marking scheme.</p>

						<p class='dummy-text'>Event Name : Wiki Wars</p>
						<p class='dummy-text'>Team Size: 1</p>
						<p class='dummy-text'>Event Description : It is a nifty game that can be played with only a web browser. It tests the ability to navigate
Wikipedia and to think ahead. It is best played in a place with lots of computers that are physically next to each other
(e.g. a computer lab). Get a few friends to play. This is either the easiest or the hardest part, but it is crucial. Make
sure your Internet should be functional and reliable. Go to Wikipedia.org. Pick a start and end page. One method is
to use the "Random Article" page on the left side bar, although this may bring up extremely obscure pages. Another
is to have an assigned person pick two pages, or to alternate between players. All players should then navigate to
the starting page. Navigate to the target page using wiki links. Some rule sets allow the use of the back button and
find function. Note: It is usually acceptable to use the back button to get out of a page with no links in the article.
The winner should show their history to everyone else. It's interesting to follow the meandering (and at times
bizarre) nature of wiki links, and will prevent cheating. It is considered cheating to backspace pages, or use the "find
on page" tool.</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>A) 2-player Challenge’: The form of the Wikipedia game where two people take it in turns to ask the other to
navigate between two pages of their choosing, e.g. from Teletubbies to noodles. The number of clicks taken is
counted, and once a player has completed the challenge, he sets the other a challenge of his own. The winner is the
person who completes the game in the least number of clicks</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>B) ‘Time Trials’: Rather than using the click rules, the winner can be determined by whoever reaches the "Homing
Page" in the shortest amount of time. This is easier with two parallel machines, although it should be noted that they
ought to have equivalent internet connections.</p>
<p class='dummy-text'>C) 'Clicks to Hitler': Believed to be the original form of 'The Wikipedia Game, 'the objective is to begin by selecting
the 'Random Article' link. From there you look at the selected article and click the links in the main body of the
article that are believed to lead to the Adolf Hitler article. Two players or more can play and they count the number
of articles it takes to get to Adolf Hitler. The person who gets there with the least number of articles wins.</p>
