        <p>
            Eureka, the flagship event of Pantheon'18 is an opportunity for the smartest and quirkiest
            teenagers to bring out the explorer in themselves. For the preliminary round, the basic idea of the project
            is
            to be mailed along with the relevant pictures. The best entries get a chance to feature their models for
            the
            final exhibition.
